% PHASESYMMONO - phase symmetry of an image using monogenic filters
%
% This function calculates the phase symmetry of points in an image.
% This is a contrast invariant measure of symmetry.  This function can be
% used as a line and blob detector.  The greyscale 'polarity' of the lines
% that you want to find can be specified.
%
% This code is considerably faster than PHASESYM but you may prefer the
% output from PHASESYM's oriented filters.
%
% There are potentially many arguments, here is the full usage:
%
%   [phaseSym, symmetryEnergy, T] = ...
%                phasesymmono(im, nscale, minWaveLength, mult, ...
%                         sigmaOnf, k, polarity, noiseMethod)
%
% However, apart from the image, all parameters have defaults and the
% usage can be as simple as:
%
%    phaseSym = phasesymmono(im);
% 
% Arguments:
%              Default values      Description
%
%    nscale           5    - Number of wavelet scales, try values 3-6
%    minWaveLength    3    - Wavelength of smallest scale filter.
%    mult             2.1  - Scaling factor between successive filters.
%    sigmaOnf         0.55 - Ratio of the standard deviation of the Gaussian 
%                            describing the log Gabor filter's transfer function 
%                            in the frequency domain to the filter center frequency.
%    k                2.0  - No of standard deviations of the noise energy beyond
%                            the mean at which we set the noise threshold point.
%                            You may want to vary this up to a value of 10 or
%                            20 for noisy images 
%    polarity         0    - Controls 'polarity' of symmetry features to find.
%                             1 - just return 'bright' points
%                            -1 - just return 'dark' points
%                             0 - return bright and dark points.
%    noiseMethod      -1   - Parameter specifies method used to determine
%                            noise statistics. 
%                              -1 use median of smallest scale filter responses
%                              -2 use mode of smallest scale filter responses
%                               0+ use noiseMethod value as the fixed noise threshold 
%                            A value of 0 will turn off all noise compensation.
%
% Return values:
%    phaseSym              - Phase symmetry image (values between 0 and 1).
%    symmetryEnergy        - Un-normalised raw symmetry energy which may be
%                            more to your liking.
%    T                     - Calculated noise threshold (can be useful for
%                            diagnosing noise characteristics of images)
%
%
% Notes on specifying parameters:  
%
% The parameters can be specified as a full list eg.
%  >> phaseSym = phasesym(im, 5, 3, 2.5, 0.55, 2.0, 0);
%
% or as a partial list with unspecified parameters taking on default values
%  >> phaseSym = phasesym(im, 5, 3);
%
% or as a partial list of parameters followed by some parameters specified via a
% keyword-value pair, remaining parameters are set to defaults, for example:
%  >> phaseSym = phasesym(im, 5, 3, 'polarity',-1, 'k', 2.5);
% 
% The convolutions are done via the FFT.  Many of the parameters relate to the
% specification of the filters in the frequency plane.  The values do not seem
% to be very critical and the defaults are usually fine.  You may want to
% experiment with the values of 'nscales' and 'k', the noise compensation factor.
%
% Notes on filter settings to obtain even coverage of the spectrum
% sigmaOnf       .85   mult 1.3
% sigmaOnf       .75   mult 1.6     (filter bandwidth ~1 octave)
% sigmaOnf       .65   mult 2.1  
% sigmaOnf       .55   mult 3       (filter bandwidth ~2 octaves)
%
% For maximum speed the input image should have dimensions that correspond to
% powers of 2, but the code will operate on images of arbitrary size.

    % Assuming the noise is Gaussian the response of the filters to noise will

    % scale as a guide to the underlying noise level because the smallest scale

    % occasionally responding to features. Either the median, or the mode, of
    % the distribution of filter responses can be used as a robust statistic to
    % estimate the distribution mean and standard deviation as these are related
    % to the median or mode by fixed constants.  The response of the larger
    % scale filters to noise can then be estimated from the smallest scale
    % filter response according to their relative bandwidths.
    %
    % This code assumes that the expected reponse to noise on the phase symmetry
    % calculation is simply the sum of the expected noise responses of each of

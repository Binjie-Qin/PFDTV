% PHASECONG2 - Computes edge and corner phase congruency in an image.
%
% This function calculates the PC_2 measure of phase congruency.  
% This function supersedes PHASECONG
%
% There are potentially many arguments, here is the full usage:
%
%   [M m or ft pc EO] = phasecong2(im, nscale, norient, minWaveLength, ...
%                         mult, sigmaOnf, dThetaOnSigma, k, cutOff, g)
%
% However, apart from the image, all parameters have defaults and the
% usage can be as simple as:
%
%    M = phasecong2(im);
% 
% Arguments:
%              Default values      Description
%
%    nscale           4    - Number of wavelet scales, try values 3-6
%    norient          6    - Number of filter orientations.
%    minWaveLength    3    - Wavelength of smallest scale filter.
%    mult             2.1  - Scaling factor between successive filters.
%    sigmaOnf         0.55 - Ratio of the standard deviation of the Gaussian 
%                            describing the log Gabor filter's transfer function 
%                            in the frequency domain to the filter center frequency.
%    dThetaOnSigma    1.2  - Ratio of angular interval between filter orientations
%                            and the standard deviation of the angular Gaussian
%                            function used to construct filters in the
%                            freq. plane.
%    k                2.0  - No of standard deviations of the noise energy beyond
%                            the mean at which we set the noise threshold point.
%                            You may want to vary this up to a value of 10 or
%                            20 for noisy images 
%    cutOff           0.5  - The fractional measure of frequency spread
%                            below which phase congruency values get penalized.
%    g                10   - Controls the sharpness of the transition in
%                            the sigmoid function used to weight phase
%                            congruency for frequency spread.                        
%
% Returned values:
%    M          - Maximum moment of phase congruency covariance.
%                 This is used as a indicator of edge strength.
%    m          - Minimum moment of phase congruency covariance.
%                 This is used as a indicator of corner strength.
%    or         - Orientation image in integer degrees 0-180,
%                 positive anticlockwise.
%                 0 corresponds to a vertical edge, 90 is horizontal.
%    ft         - *Not correctly implemented at this stage*
%                 A complex valued image giving the weighted mean 
%                 phase angle at every point in the image for each
%                 orientation. 
%    pc         - Cell array of phase congruency images (values between 0 and 1)   
%                 for each orientation
%    EO         - A 2D cell array of complex valued convolution results
%
%   EO{s,o} = convolution result for scale s and orientation o.  The real part
%   is the result of convolving with the even symmetric filter, the imaginary
%   part is the result from convolution with the odd symmetric filter.
%
%   Hence:
%       abs(EO{s,o}) returns the magnitude of the convolution over the
%       image at scale s and orientation o.
%       angle(EO{s,o}) returns the phase angles.
%   
% Notes on specifying parameters:  
%
% The parameters can be specified as a full list eg.
%  >> [M m or ft pc EO] = phasecong2(im, 5, 6, 3, 2.5, 0.55, 1.2, 2.0, 0.4, 10);
%
% or as a partial list with unspecified parameters taking on default values
%  >> [M m or ft pc EO] = phasecong2(im, 5, 6, 3);
%
% or as a partial list of parameters followed by some parameters specified via a
% keyword-value pair, remaining parameters are set to defaults, for example:
%  >> [M m or ft pc EO] = phasecong2(im, 5, 6, 3, 'cutOff', 0.3, 'k', 2.5);
% 
% The convolutions are done via the FFT.  Many of the parameters relate to the
% specification of the filters in the frequency plane.  The values do not seem
% to be very critical and the defaults are usually fine.  You may want to
% experiment with the values of 'nscales' and 'k', the noise compensation factor.
%
% Notes on filter settings to obtain even coverage of the spectrum
% dthetaOnSigma 1.2    norient 6
% sigmaOnf       .85   mult 1.3
% sigmaOnf       .75   mult 1.6     (filter bandwidth ~1 octave)
% sigmaOnf       .65   mult 2.1  
% sigmaOnf       .55   mult 3       (filter bandwidth ~2 octaves)
%
% For maximum speed the input image should have dimensions that correspond to
% powers of 2, but the code will operate on images of arbitrary size.

% PHASESYM - Function for computing phase symmetry on an image.
%
% This function calculates the phase symmetry of points in an image.
% This is a contrast invariant measure of symmetry.  This function can be
% used as a line and blob detector.  The greyscale 'polarity' of the lines
% that you want to find can be specified.
%
% There are potentially many arguments, here is the full usage:
%
%   [phaseSym, orientation, totalEnergy, T] = ...
%                phasesym(im, nscale, norient, minWaveLength, mult, ...
%                         sigmaOnf, k, polarity, noiseMethod)
%
% However, apart from the image, all parameters have defaults and the
% usage can be as simple as:
%
%    phaseSym = phasesym(im);
% 
% Arguments:
%              Default values      Description
%
%    nscale           5    - Number of wavelet scales, try values 3-6
%    norient          6    - Number of filter orientations.
%    minWaveLength    3    - Wavelength of smallest scale filter.
%    mult             2.1  - Scaling factor between successive filters.
%    sigmaOnf         0.55 - Ratio of the standard deviation of the Gaussian 
%                            describing the log Gabor filter's transfer function 
%                            in the frequency domain to the filter center frequency.
%    k                2.0  - No of standard deviations of the noise energy beyond
%                            the mean at which we set the noise threshold point.
%                            You may want to vary this up to a value of 10 or
%                            20 for noisy images 
%    polarity         0    - Controls 'polarity' of symmetry features to find.
%                             1 - just return 'bright' points
%                            -1 - just return 'dark' points
%                             0 - return bright and dark points.
%    noiseMethod      -1   - Parameter specifies method used to determine
%                            noise statistics. 
%                              -1 use median of smallest scale filter responses
%                              -2 use mode of smallest scale filter responses
%                               0+ use noiseMethod value as the fixed noise threshold.
%
% Return values:
%    phaseSym              - Phase symmetry image (values between 0 and 1).
%    orientation           - Orientation image. Orientation in which local
%                            symmetry energy is a maximum, in degrees
%                            (0-180), angles positive anti-clockwise. Note
%                            the orientation info is quantized by the number
%                            of orientations
%    totalEnergy           - Un-normalised raw symmetry energy which may be
%                            more to your liking.
%    T                     - Calculated noise threshold (can be useful for
%                            diagnosing noise characteristics of images).  Once you know
%                            this you can then specify fixed thresholds and save some
%                            computation time.
%
% Notes on specifying parameters:  
%
% The parameters can be specified as a full list eg.
%  >> phaseSym = phasesym(im, 5, 6, 3, 2.5, 0.55, 2.0, 0);
%
% or as a partial list with unspecified parameters taking on default values
%  >> phaseSym = phasesym(im, 5, 6, 3);
%
% or as a partial list of parameters followed by some parameters specified via a
% keyword-value pair, remaining parameters are set to defaults, for example:
%  >> phaseSym = phasesym(im, 5, 6, 3, 'polarity',-1, 'k', 2.5);
% 
% The convolutions are done via the FFT.  Many of the parameters relate to the
% specification of the filters in the frequency plane.  The values do not seem
% to be very critical and the defaults are usually fine.  You may want to
% experiment with the values of 'nscales' and 'k', the noise compensation factor.
%
% Notes on filter settings to obtain even coverage of the spectrum
% sigmaOnf       .85   mult 1.3
% sigmaOnf       .75   mult 1.6     (filter bandwidth ~1 octave)
% sigmaOnf       .65   mult 2.1  
% sigmaOnf       .55   mult 3       (filter bandwidth ~2 octaves)
%
% For maximum speed the input image should have dimensions that correspond to
% powers of 2, but the code will operate on images of arbitrary size.

% RAYLEIGHMODE
%
% Computes mode of a vector/matrix of data that is assumed to come from a
% Rayleigh distribution.
%
% Usage:  rmode = rayleighmode(data, nbins)
%
% Arguments:  data  - data assumed to come from a Rayleigh distribution
%             nbins - Optional number of bins to use when forming histogram
%                     of the data to determine the mode.
%
% Mode is computed by forming a histogram of the data over 50 bins and then
% finding the maximum value in the histogram.  Mean and standard deviation
% can then be calculated from the mode as they are related by fixed
% constants.
%
% mean = mode * sqrt(pi/2)
% std dev = mode * sqrt((4-pi)/2)
%

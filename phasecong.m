% PHASECONG - Computes phase congruency on an image.
%
% Usage: [pc or ft] = phasecong(im)
%
% This function calculates the PC_2 measure of phase congruency.  
% For maximum speed the input image should be square and have a 
% size that is a power of 2, but the code will operate on images
% of arbitrary size.  
%
%
% Returned values:
%                 pc - Phase congruency image (values between 0 and 1)   
%                 or - Orientation image.  Provides orientation in which 
%                      local energy is a maximum in in degrees (0-180), 
%                      angles positive anti-clockwise.
%                 ft - A complex valued image giving the weighted mean 
%                      phase angle at every point in the image for the 
%                      orientation having maximum energy.  Use the
%                      function DISPFEAT to display this data.
%
% Parameters:  
%                 im - A greyscale image to be processed.
%                 
% You can also specify numerous optional parameters.  See the code to find
% out what they are.  The convolutions are done via the FFT.  Many of the
% parameters relate to the specification of the filters in the frequency
% plane.  Default values for parameters are set within the file rather than
% being required as arguments because they rarely need to be changed - nor
% are they very critical.  However, you may want to experiment with
% specifying/editing the values of `nscales' and `noiseCompFactor'.
%
% Note this phase congruency code is very computationally expensive and uses
% *lots* of memory.
%
%
% Example MATLAB session:
%
% >> im = imread('picci.tif');   
% >> image(im);                          % Display the image
% >> [pc or ft] = phasecong(im);
% >> imagesc(pc), colormap(gray);        % Display the phase congruency image
%
%
% To convert the phase congruency image to an edge map (with my usual parameters):
%
% >> nm = nonmaxsup(pc, or, 1.5);        % Non-maxima suppression.  
%    The parameter 1.5 can result in edges more than 1 pixel wide but helps
%    in picking up `broad' maxima.
% >> edgim = hysthresh(nm, 0.4, 0.2);    % Hysteresis thresholding.
% >> edgeim = bwmorph(edgim,'skel',Inf); % Skeletonize the edgemap to fix
%                                        % the non-maximal suppression.
% >> imagesc(edgeim), colormap(gray);
%
%
% To display the different feature types present in your image use:
%
% >> dispfeat(ft,edgim);
%
% With a small amount of editing the code can be modified to calculate
% a dimensionless measure of local symmetry in the image.  The basis
% of this is that one looks for points in the image where the local 
% phase is 90 or 270 degrees (the symmetric points in the cycle).
% Editing instructions are within the code.
